# tic-tac-toe

After a good amount of time spent building the foundation in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm glad to say I was somewhat close to the answer key.
Or had the right idea but unsure how to write it.

Had my layout and content pretty good in my HTML and CSS. For JS, the layout, variables, and consts were there. However, the functions I 
for sure had a hard time in getting things to work.

Defintely need to spend more time in analyzing the code, messing around with it, until I feel more confident in doing this on my own 
in the near future.

Trust the process. Don't give up.
